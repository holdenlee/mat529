\chapter*{Introduction}
Notes from Assaf Naor's class ``Geometric inequalities with applications to metric embeddings" at Princeton in Spring 2016. 

More generally we'll cover metric geometry.

I'll teach things that just appeared or are still in the works. Most of them aren't in books yet; some of them haven't even be written yet. I'll give a taste of what's going on in the field. I'll choose topics with many open questions associated with them and with self-contained proofs. 

This is a huge area. I'll use proofs of major theorems as excuses to see the lemmas that go into the proofs. The theorems are famous; in addition to being famous, they use lemmas that are immensely powerful. Instead of presenting the geometric inequalities and then applications afterwards, we'll see the lemmas on the way to proving these big theorems.

%twists in proofs new, useful.
Express your interest---I'm flexible.

%I taught a course.
%no overlap.

%some commericals on what to prove later, puzzles.
